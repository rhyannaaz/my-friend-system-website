     <li>Which parts did you have trouble with?
       <br><br>
       <ul>
         <li>Task 8 because pagination was new to me and I had to do further research in incorporating it within the system. After all, I did manage to successfully incorporate it.</li>
         <li>Task 9 because I did not manage to figure out the commands to obtain the mutual friend count.</li>
       </ul>

     <li>What would you like to do better next time?
       <br><br>
       <ul>
         <li>User interface - I would construct a more interactive user interface to increase the quality of experience users have when using the program.</li>
         <li>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - I would try to form the program using OOP principles as I believe that improvements can be made to some of the functions.</li>
         <li>Time management - I overestimated my capabilities of completing this assignment, hence I would like to improve my time management skills next time.</li>

     <li>A screen shot of a discussion response that answered someone’s thread in the unit’s
      discussion board for Assignment 2?
       <br><br>I did not participate in the unit's discussion board. I did not post any questions within the board because I believe the requirements
       of this assignment has been clarified in detail by the lecturer and the tutor during classes. I did not answer any questions posted within the
       board because they would have a lready been answered by other students or lecturers.
